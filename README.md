## Hi, I'm Charlotte!
I'm a senior at Bennington College studying Data Science and Mathematics. My academic work spans statistics, mathematical modeling, and coding, and I also have a passion for ceramics and exploring interdisciplinary art forms 🎨.

I work with Python, R, and GIS tools to explore data, and I’m especially interested in using data science to tackle environmental issues. I enjoy combining technical analysis with creative projects, such as my work in ceramics and designing interactive projects.

In my free time I enjoy snowboarding 🏂 and rock climbing 🧗‍♀️.

I love exploring new places 🗺️, and I'm always looking for new adventures ✈️!
